# HackStory

## About This Project

HackStory was created for a hackathon focused on exploring and celebrating history. The goal was to highlight lesser-known figures who have made significant contributions to society. I chose to center this project on **Bayard Rustin**, an unsung hero of the civil rights movement. Rustin was a key organizer of the 1963 March on Washington and a lifelong advocate for nonviolence and social justice. Despite his pivotal role, he is often overlooked in mainstream history, in part because he was openly gay at a time when this was met with widespread discrimination.

By sharing Rustin's story, this project aims to shed light on the importance of recognizing all voices in history, especially those who have been marginalized.
