        <p style={styles.paragraph}>
          Bayard Rustin was a key figure in the civil rights movement, known for his
          pioneering nonviolent activism and strategic genius. Despite his profound
          impact, history often overlooked his contributions due to prevailing social biases.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.paragraph}>
          Rustin was the chief architect of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom,
          where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic "I Have a Dream" speech. He believed
          in peaceful protest, coalition-building, and universal human rights.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.paragraph}>
          In his personal life, Bayard was openly gay and deeply committed to justice. He adopted
          his longtime partner, Walter Naegle, in the late 1970sâ€”a legal workaround for same-sex couples
          at the time to secure family rights.
